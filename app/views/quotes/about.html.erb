        I have built this web page using ruby code, with the help of my friends at University of Phoenix Coding Boot Camp! It isn't much and well I am only at the beginning stages still but i hope to gain the knowledge I need to be able to do many things in code. Fingers crossed, and still going.

        I saw this cute little picture of a cat and thought OMG, that is the one i am going to use. Oh and doing nothing else but trying to write something else until nothing else can be written on this page but it seems .... they ran out.
